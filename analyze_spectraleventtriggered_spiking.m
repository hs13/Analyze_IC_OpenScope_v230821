%% basic spectral event analyses
% are there clear "bands" of spectral event frequencies? (boundary between beta and gamma
% beta events are characterized by a prominent supragranuar sink -- do gamma events have a granular sink? and what about alpha events?

 
%% first, get psth of spectral events (vis stim aligned)

%% in continuous data, calculate event triggered
